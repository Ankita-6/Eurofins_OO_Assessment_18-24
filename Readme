Welcome to our coding solutions repository!

This repository is created to streamline the process of submitting coding solutions for our evaluation process,
we kindly request you to upload your coding solutions in the form of zip folders to this repository.

Please ensure that each zip folder contains all the necessary files related to your coding solution, including source code, documentation (if applicable),
and any additional resources required for evaluation.

To maintain clarity and organization, we recommend following these guidelines:

1. Create a separate zip folder for each coding challenge or task.
2. Name your zip folders descriptively, Your Name Underscore indicating the challenge/task name or number.
3. Include a README file within each zip folder, providing a brief overview of your solution, any special considerations, and instructions for execution/testing.

Thank you for your cooperation, and we look forward to reviewing your coding solutions!

Best regards,
Mayank
